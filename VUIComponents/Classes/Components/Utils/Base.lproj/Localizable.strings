"Roaming Tips 1" = "• All Vodafone Postpaid customers are eligible for free roaming activation after paying 4 bills. \n \n • If you are a new postpaid customer and still haven’t paid 4 bills, you can still enjoy roaming up to 250LE on your bill or you can register your credit card in one of Vodafone’s stores for payments to be carried out through direct debit. Please call 888 to activate your roaming. \n \n • If you are a new Vodafone Postpaid customer and still didn’t pay 4 bills, you can register your credit card in one of Vodafone's stores for payments to be carried out through direct debit. Locate your nearest Vodafone store to register your credit card. \n \n• If you are a Vodafone Prepaid, Control, or Easy customer you can activate the roaming service for FREE from day one, dial *888*5# or *999*5#. \n \n • Check roaming services availability and roaming rates in the country you are going to visit . \n \n • Make sure you have a compatible power adapter so you can charge your phone. We recommend that you take a World Travel Adaptor available in the local market that allows you to use your mobile charger anywhere around the world. \n \n • If you have any pre-paid, Control, or Easy line, make sure you have enough credit to use while roaming. \n \n • If you are going to top-up using your credit card while roaming, make sure you have the Vodafone Services menu on your phone. Locate your nearest Vodafone store to get a new SIM and register your credit card.";



"Roaming Tips 2" = "• Switch on your mobile. \n \n • In most cases, your mobile will automatically search for and register on a network. \n • If not, check your phone's user guide to find out how to search for a network manually. \n \n • Where available, select the local Vodafone network for the best rates and service. \n \n • We will text you to inform you about roaming rates on the network you are roaming on, and will also let you know if there is a preferred network in the country you are visiting for best roaming rates and service. Keep this SMS on your phone for further reference.";

"Roaming Tips 3" = "1. Please Call Me \n  Are you out of credit? Dial *505* mobile number # so you can use our Please Call Me service for 0.75 LE while roaming. However, please note that some networks do not support our Please Call Me service.\n \n 2. Divert to Voicemail \n Open line customers can divert all incoming calls to their Vodafone voicemail and avoid any roaming charges. \n \n 3. Turn off Automatic Updates \n  Some phones and computers have programs that automatically download updates and new versions once they are connected to the internet. Turn off automatic updates before you roam as they might consume a considerable volume of data. Go to Start > Control Panel > Security Centre > Automatic Updates, select ‘Turn off automatic updates’ and press ‘OK’.";


"Roaming Tips 4" = "• Dialing from abroad \n \n  If you are calling Egypt, make sure you replace the first zero with +20 (e.g. 0100-1-888-888 becomes +20-100-1-888-888). \n \n  • Receiving Calls Abroad \n \n When you're overseas, the person calling you from Egypt pays the same as they always do to call you while you are in Egypt. However, you will be charged when receiving calls anywhere in the world depending on the country you are visiting and the operator you are roaming on. This charge is to forward your incoming calls overseas. To check the rate of receiving calls while roaming. \n \n  • How do I contact Customer Care while I'm abroad?  \n \n To call customer care from abroad, dial +20-100-1-888-888. All Vodafone Free and Business Bouquet customers can call our customer care for free from all over the world. For prepaid, Control, and Easy rate plans, calling customer care while roaming will be charged as a normal call to Egypt.  \n \n  In some countries, you can also call Vodafone Egypt customer care for FREE from any Vodafone store at the country you are visiting. \n \n •  Using your Voicemail \n \n  To divert incoming calls to your Vodafone voicemail, make sure you are diverting to +20-10-1-808-808 and you will continue receiving notification SMSs when you get a message in your voice mailbox. If you have a Vodafone Free or Vodafone Business Bouquet line, you can divert calls to your voice mail for FREE. \n  \n To check your voice mailbox, call +20-100-1-808-808. This call will be charged as a normal call to Egypt. \n  \n • Balance Inquiry \n \n  To find out your balance while abroad, dial *868*1#. This service is free while roaming. \n  \n This service is only available with a specific list of operators.";
